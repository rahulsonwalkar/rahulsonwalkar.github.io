### Hacking into Hackathons

Hackathon registrations can be hacked. [Here's](http://rahul.ru/blog/hacking-into-hackathons) how you could do it.


### My experience at Sabre's Hack TTX 2017

This past summer, my friends and I flew to Las Vegas to attend Sabre's Annual Hackathon (Hack TTX). My team's IoT hack, Flyo, won the Grand Prize and I wrote about our experience on UT Dallas [CS Department's website](http://cs.utdallas.edu/2017-student-summer-computer-science-experiences/) and on [Sabre's blog](https://www.sabre.com/insights/developers-go-all-in-at-hackathonttx-in-las-vegas/)


### A collection of links and resources (updated)

A collection of links and resources that I found extremely helpful. Contains both programming and non-programming resources and can be found [here](http://rahul.ru/resources).
