### My experience at Sabre's Hack TTX 2017

This summer, I had a wonderful opportunity to fly to Las Vegas to attend Sabre's Annual Hackathon (Hack TTX). My team's IoT hack, Flyo, won the Grand Prize and I wrote about our experience on UT Dallas [CS Department's website](http://cs.utdallas.edu/2017-student-summer-computer-science-experiences/) and on [Sabre's blog](https://www.sabre.com/insights/developers-go-all-in-at-hackathonttx-in-las-vegas/)
