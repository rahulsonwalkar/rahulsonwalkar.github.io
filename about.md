## About Me

## About Hackers UTD

[Hackers UTD](https://hackersutd.com) is a hackathon enthusiast club at UT Dallas. We're a bunch of students who love learning new technologies and working on cool ideas. We intend to spread it across campus and get more students involved with technology :)

In Spring 2018, we're organizing internal hackathon at UTD to help improve the campus.
